 Last month, I went to a medical institution for a annual healthy examination. I did all the checks as usual. When the report arrived to my hand a week later, there were sth shocked me. An index called (EBV-antibodies) signified that my data was surpassed the normal standard a lot. I firstly went to Google to learn sth more about it. To my surprise, the Google said it is likely that I have a cancer inside my nose. Oh my god. There are some typical symtoms like nosebleed, blocked nose, and headacahe. And almost every thing that happens in my body during that time. I felt wholely depressed. The sky was dark, the food was insipid, and everythig was unteresting. I even told my best friends that i might die soon. And I don't know what to do and how much time i still have. But luckily, I had another specific check two days later and the result turned out that i am still a healty man.

 That's a horrible story and I've leanerd a lot from it. Except the imortance of healty, I also rememberd the feeling clearly. It was nerv-racking. It means that in that situation it made me terrible, nervers and anctious. When there is sth that is unknown or dangerous that you can't control it by yourself, you can say you are nerv-racking. For example, when there will be a exam tommorrow but you still have some knowledge you don't understand totally or when you have done sth wrong and your boss is discussing whether or not they will fire you or when you don't know whehter or not your lover is still loving you, you can say 'I am nerv-racking'. So nerv-racking is an ajective to descibe your feeling and it means that you feel very tense and worried about sth. As we all konw, life is difficult and time is hard. There is always sth nerv-racking that happens even unexpectedly. I wish everyone is lucky enough to cope with it and have a good result finnaly.
