Last month, I went to a hospital for an annual healthy examination. When the report arrived at my hand, it showed that my data surpassed the normal level a lot at an index. I first went to Google to learn sth more about it. To my surprise, Google suggested I probably have cancer inside my nose. I felt wholely terrified. The sky was dark, the food was insipid, and everything was uninteresting. I even told my best friends that I might die soon.  But luckily, I had another specific check two days later and the result turned out that I am still a healthy man.

That's a horrible story and I've learned a lot from it. Except for the importance of healthy, I happen to find a word to describe the feeling I  had clearly. It is nerve-racking.  You can use it when there is sth unknown or dangerous that makes you very tense and worried. For example, when there will be a final exam tomorrow but you still don't understand a mass of knowledge totally or when you should hand in a report to your boss the next day that decides whether you can get a salary increase but you haven't yet written a word or when you feel unhappy about your job now but you can't figure out what you want, at these time you can say 'I am nerve-racking'.  

Life is difficult and time is hard. There is always sth nerve-racking that happens even unexpectedly. I wish everyone is lucky enough to cope with it and have a good result finally.
