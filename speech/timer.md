Good evening everyone. My name is Michael and I am honored to be your timer tonight, My job is to time everyone who will have a speech tonight. Before you come to the stage, you should identify how much time you have to finish your speech and you should comply with it.

I will alert you of the time you have left, using the green, yellow, and red cards.  When you see the green card, there are 2 minutes left, the yellow card, one minute, and the red card, only 30 seconds. And I also have a bell which denotes time is up. So, when the bear is ringing, you must stop talking and leave the stage.

At the end of the meeting, I will give you my report about the situation of time control of everybody. I am looking forward to your speech very much. Thank you.

 Everyone is doing a great job except xxx, xxx, xx, xx. oh no, just kidding. 
We do not even hear the ringing of the bell in any speech, that's great.




1. Tonight, We heard the bell's ringing in xxx,xxx's speech, very lively, I think that you should shorten the main part and draw a conclusion when you see the yellow card. For you, less is more.

2. For xxxx, Your speech is logic and coherent and your ability of time control is perfect.
 
3. For xxxx, your are so generous because there are so much time left when you end. You should spend more time in giving more details of your speech.

Time is money , we shoul make full use of it not only in our speech but also in our life.



1. lack of time
For xxxx, I notice that you do not have much time to make a conclusion, but you finished your speech briefly and timely. Good job.

2. enough


3. exceed time limit

For all, time is the most valuable thing for everyone. We should make most of the time to express our oponion completely. That's all, thank you.
