Good evening everyone. My name is Michael and I am honored to be your timer tonight, My job is to time everyone who will have a speech tonight. Before you come to the stage, you should identify how much time you have to finish your speech and you should comply with it.

I will alert you of the time you have left, using the green, yellow, and red cards.  When you see the green card, there are 2 minutes left, the yellow card, one minute, and the red card, only 30 seconds. And I also have a bell which denotes time is up. So, when the bear is ringing, you must stop talking and leave the stage.

At the end of the meeting, I will give you my report about the situation of time control of everybody. I am looking forward to your speech very much. Thank you.
