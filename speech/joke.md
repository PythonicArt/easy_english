A man is talking to God.

The man: "God, how long is a million years?"
God: "To me, it's about a minute."

The man: "God, how much is a million dollars?"
God: "To me it's a penny."

The man: "God, may I have a penny?"
God: "Wait a minute."

One, day. A family of mice were surprised by a big cat.
Father Mouse jumped and and said, "Bow-wow!" The cat ran away.
"What was that, Father?" asked Baby Mouse. "Well, son, that's why it's important to learn a second language."



Some scientists decided to do the following experiments on a dog.
For the first experiment, they cut off one leg from the dog, then they told the dog to walk. The dog got up and walked easily.
For the second experiment, they cut off a second leg from the dog, then they told the dog once more to walk. The dog was still able to walk with only two legs. For the third experiment, they cut off yet another leg from the dog,  Although the scientists shouted at the dog loudly many times, nothing happened. As a result of these three experiments, the scientists got a conclusion 'After having three legs cut off, the dog had lost its ability to hear'.


Last week was my birthday.
My wife didn’t wish me.
My parents forgot, so did my kids.
I went to work, and not even did my colleagues wish me.
As I prepared to go home after work in the evening, my secretary rushed to me and said,
“Happy birthday Boss. Can I take you out for dinner?”
I felt so special. After dinner, she invited me to her apartment. We went there, and she said,
“I want to surprise you. Do you mind if I go to the bedroom for a minute?”
I agreed immediately. She came out five minutes later with a cake, my wife, my kids, my friends, and my colleagues… all screaming.
“S-u-r-p-r-i-s-e…”
