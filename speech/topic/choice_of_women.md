Each woman has the ability to make her own decision about what to do rather than being influenced by someone else or told what to do. About a year ago, i had a girlfriend. She is tall, cute, beautiful and playful. I loved her very much. I made a choice and promised her : "you are responsible for blooming like a flower, i am responsible for making money to water you". But one day, she said to me unexpected:"Look how stupid you are. I hate the books you read and all your friends. The music you are listening is shit. Look at the pictures you had taken for me,  what a big face I have and it looks like a basketball. I don't care no more so don't you worry, goodbye, i'm going home."She make a choice and dumped me. I had no choice even though i was so sad. She was free and she had this autonomy to decide a boy with whom she want to have a relationship. And so are you, every single or none-single beautiful lady who are here tonight. It's your chioce to consider whether going out for shopping, or playing games at home, or coming here to share stories with each other. And, Your made a better choice. 

Somtimes, we can not only have freedom to make a choice but we have a responsibilty to have a significant choice.  

As we all know, in the past six months, we have experienced an unprecedented, global, dangerous challange, the coronavirus pandemic. We have no choice to stay at home, to work at home, even to do everything at home. We have no choice and we are helpless. Still, there were so many physicians, nurses, medical members even volunteers who were brave enough to stand out at the critical situation. And many of them are women. They make a selfless choice to sacrifice their time, to risk their life to save other people's life. They worked day and night under rough condition even lack of essential protective equipment.  Due to their hard working and unselfish devotion, our country has curved the spread of the covid-19 effectively. With their noble spirit, we believe that we will defeat the virus finnally in the near furture. As the media reported, they are most beautiful people who brave a dangerous situation. They are heros of our country.

Let us clap for all the women who make a big difference for our life, that's all i want to say, tank you very much.

And I had no choice except crying alone. I admit that she has autonomy to descide which guy she loves or which thing she likes. She is free enough. And so are you, every single or non-single beautiful lady who is here tonight. It's your choice to consider whether going out for shopping, or playing games at home, or coming here to share stories and opinions. Well, You made a better choice.
