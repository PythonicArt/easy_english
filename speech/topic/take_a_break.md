life-work balance

And what does that mean? 
It means the work hours of 9am to 9pm, six days a week. That's contrasted with other startups that do 997.

Sometimes we are depressed for this or another reason. There are a lot of ways to take a break.

If I could offer you one tip for taking a rest, listening to music would be it. In my opinion, It's one of the best ways to relax. When you immerse yourself in music, you will forget tiredness and boring of working and studying. You can even dance and move your body freely. You can do it anytime and anywhere.

To have a reset, You can also eat out for a big dinner. Last year, I have a girlfriend who is a foodie who likes eating very much, especially Pickled Fish. When his birthday is coming, I asked him what gift do you want this year? He smiled and answered,  oh man, I don't want anything except that you take me out to eat pickled fish every weekend. I was shocked. I don't like pickled pish so much. Unsurprisingly, he left me and went out to find another fishing guy.

Reading a book is another effective one. A book is a good tutor for us when we face problems we can not solve. It is also a valid amusement when we are tired, boring even sick of the world. For me, an interesting book is a paradise in which I hide to escape the real world. I can attain a lot of stories, ideas, opinions in books. It enriches my life and makes me feel no longer empty and lonely.

In the end, we can chat with friends. After you have tried different ways to save yourself, you are still not feeling very good. Maybe you should make a phone call to your best friend and try to say something to them. No man is an island and Everyone is sociable. At this time, we just need a good partner to accompany us. When you finish your talk, all the bad feelings will be going away, and happiness, passion, enthusiasm all the good things are coming back. Finally, you will embrace the world and say "love and peace".
