# AD 与 BC

AD is AFTER Jesus Christ was born.
BC is BEFORE Jesus Christ was born.

AD stands for the Latin Anno Domini meaning "In the year of Our Lord".
BC stands for Before Christ.

BC is always written after the year. AD may be written before the year or (modern style) after the year. If a year is shown without AD or BC, it is usually AD.

CE stands for "Common Era" and is the same as AD.
BCE stands for "Before Common Era" and is the same as BC
