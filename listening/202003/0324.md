# 0327-voa-田地里的智能艺术家
So this piece called yelu is propobably from about 10 years ago, from the body of the work kind of looking at fields, the visual of the motion of tall grass in the wind.
you never see the wind but the effect of the wind
for its sort of calling to mind of the front end of harvester or a reaper
and the way that the machine enters the field and sorts of like cuts the grain() down and processes the grain
I don't think of it as() a robot() creating art
this are no more robot's than just sort of like atoms that are moving through space right now.
phenomenon
it appears in organic but actually quiet organic
But the heart of it really is controled chance that create a barrier and make some of the selection in terms of the color
The overway (in a lot of cases) comes out of more historical naratives
philosophical questions
where did you go when you die
most of  => I'm also
getting out of my routine and seeing the world
Remarkable things can be found all over the place
deviating from you normal path
